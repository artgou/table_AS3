table_AS3 is a port of many of the ActionScript 3 Array methods to Lua. The methods currently ported include:

*	concat_as3() (renamed to avoid conflict with Lua's built-in table.concat())
*	indexOf()
*	lastIndexOf()
*	pop()
*	push()
*	shift()
*	slice()
*	splice()
*	reverse()
*	unshift()


The examples folder includes a simple project that demonstrates how to use the methods. If you're already familiar with [AS3's Array class](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/beta/reference/actionscript/3/Array.html), then go to town. If not, give it a read to get an understanding of the full capabilities of the various methods.
